# devcli

`devcli` is a command line tool to create command line tools.

Often during projects we need to create some command line tools to
automate some tasks. `devcli` helps you by providing the boiler plate
code for extensible command line scripts in bash.

Its goal is to quick get you started creating your own commands
without having recreate some common tasks like issuing commands on
vagrant machines, help messages, terminal coloring, tailing logs and
so on.
